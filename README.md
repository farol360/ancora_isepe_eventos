# Ancora - just a PHP way to construct web applications.

This is a tool built by [Maur√≠cio Fauth](https://github.com/mauriciofauth) and [Thiago Nardi](https://github.com/thnardi) to develop web apps.

## Dependences

 - php 7+;
 - Composer;
 - Jquery;
 - Bootstrap 3;
 - [Tim Creative Material Kit](https://github.com/timcreative).


## Key Concepts and references.

This section's objective is to guide anyone ho wants to work with ancora, explain his basic usage.

The core of application are built with [Slim 3 Framework](https://www.slimframework.com). To understand the code you must focus on slim's *routes* and *dependecies* management and learn about his *middleware* concept.

The MVC concept are strongly implemented on this solution. Let's take an overview by MVC layers.

### Model layer

The model layer work with 2 classes: a plain class refering exactly the table in db and a same name ended by **Model** pair class with extends *src/Model.php* class. This class have all sql functions.

The way to add a new class is:
1) Supose you have an example table in you db. Create the **Example.php* in *src/model* (you can take any other class already implemented as template);
2) Create a **ExampleModel.php** in same directory;
3) Insert a function on *src/model/EntityFactory.php* with an array $data as parameter and return a new Example instance. (this is a Factory design pattern implementation);
4) Add the **exampleModel** class as atribute in controller you want to work. You will need to pass it as parameter in contructor and update constructor call on *src/dependencies* file.

### View

In View we use [Twig](https://twig.symfony.com/) engine.

Functions used in layout.twig like "get_name()" or "get_email()" are defined in src/twig/AuthExtension.php file;

### Controller

All controller classes extens *src/Controller.php*
