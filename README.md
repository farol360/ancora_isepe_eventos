# Ancora - just a PHP way to construct web applications.

This is a tool built by [Maur√≠cio Fauth](https://github.com/mauriciofauth) and [Thiago Nardi](https://github.com/thnardi) to develop web apps. We have working on this tool since 2017 in [Farol 360](https://farol360.com.br) jobs.

## Dependences

 - php 7+;
 - Composer;
 - Jquery;
 - Bootstrap 3;
 - [Tim Creative Material Kit](https://github.com/timcreative).


## Key Concepts and references.

This section's objective is to guide anyone ho wants to work with ancora, explain his basic usage.

The core of application are built with [Slim 3 Framework](https://www.slimframework.com). To understand the code you must focus on slim's *routes* and *dependecies* management and learn about his *middleware* concept.

All the solution is implemented on *app/* folder. The core files are **dependencies.php**, **middleware.php**, **routes.php** and **settings.php**. All this files contains declarations of elements we work on implemented solution. The code in it's default have the basic permissions for admin users, flash messages and Twig engine for render the view layer. You can use this implementations as template to adding new declarations as it needs.

The MVC concept are strongly implemented on this solution. Let's take an overview by MVC layers.

### Model layer

The model is implemented on *src/model/* folder. It work with 2 classes: a plain class refering exactly the table in db and a same name ended by **Model** pair class with extends *src/Model.php* class. This class have all sql functions.

The way to add a new class is:
1) Supose you have an example table in you db. Create the **Example.php** in *src/model* (you can take any other class already implemented as template);
2) Create a **ExampleModel.php** in same directory;
3) Insert a function on *src/model/EntityFactory.php* with an array $data as parameter and return a new Example instance. (this is a Factory design pattern implementation);
4) Add the **exampleModel** class as atribute in controller you want to work. You will need to pass it as parameter in contructor and update constructor call on *src/dependencies* file.

### View

In View we use [Twig](https://twig.symfony.com/) engine.

Functions used in layout.twig like "get_name()" or "get_email()" are defined in src/twig/AuthExtension.php file;

### Controller

All controller classes extens *src/Controller.php*
